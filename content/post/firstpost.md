# First website post #

## Testing creation of a post, editing, and pushing to gitio website##

Just a quick test post, to check if the site upload process is working (I really have to automate a script for this or something)

## Tools ##

Tried something different here and am using nano, the terminal text editor. I should probably eventually switch to vim or something, but I just wanted to do this fast and cheap. Let's see; another rabbit hole for another day. I think this enough text now to see what the formatting looks like.
