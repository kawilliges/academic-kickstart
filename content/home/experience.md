I am currently a scientist in the EconClim Research Group, focusing on climate change mitigation options and transitions to a low carbon economy. My current work has focused on the assessment of the current and future costs of electricity from renewable energy sources, and assessment of their broader effects within a computable generalized equilibrium model framework, as part of the European Commission-funded project, CARISMA. I also focus on policy design and implementation, with research on contextual factors surrounding policymaking, and designing policy packages to reach a low-carbon society for the Austrian research project, SHIFT.
